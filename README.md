## Getting Started

Getting started with Reusable Content is as simple as installing a plugin:

1. Upload the `gmt-edd-automatically-create-user-accounts` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.
3. Check the box under `Create User Account` for the downloads you wish to create accounts for.

And that's it, you're done. Nice work!

It's recommended that you also install the [GitHub Updater plugin](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) to get automattic updates.



## Displaying a customized message to the customer

Add your custom messages under `Downloads` > `Settings` > `Extensions`. There are two separate messages: one for users who already have an account, and one for users who had one newly created.

Include the `[gmt_edd_user]` shortcode on your Success Page.
